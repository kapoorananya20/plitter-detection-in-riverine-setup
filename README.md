# plitter-detection-in-riverine-setup
The primary goal of pLitter detection in rivers is to automatically identify and classify plastic litter within riverine environments through the use of deep learning and computer vision technologies. With an alarming **11 million metric tons** of plastic entering our oceans each year, and rivers accounting for up to 80% of this pollution, it is imperative that we implement efficient monitoring and cleanup strategies.

By delivering real-time data on pollution levels, pinpointing high-risk areas, and bolstering cleanup initiatives, pLitter seeks to significantly reduce plastic waste in rivers and safeguard aquatic ecosystems. This innovative system serves as a valuable resource for governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers, enabling them to devise targeted solutions to address the escalating plastic crisis. Through collaboration and informed action, we can work towards a cleaner, healthier environment for both our rivers and the diverse life they support.
